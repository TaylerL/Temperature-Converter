# Temperature-Converter

Just a simple temperature converter that lets the user pick a starting unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) and takes in a number, both via user input, and converts the number to the new unit. It also includes the .lower() so letter casing won't matter (i.e. the user can put in Celsius or celsius and it will still work the same).
